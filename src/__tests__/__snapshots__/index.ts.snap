File - test/fixtures/BadTernaryElvis.soy

     Use the Elvis (?:) operator instead of a ternary for default values:
     
     $optionalInfo - Line 20


File - test/fixtures/BadWhitespace.soy

     There seems to be extra whitespace on these lines:
     
     Line 8: {@param title: string }


File - test/fixtures/DocParams.soy

     Param declarations in docs is deprecated, see these templates:
     
     render
     otherHelper


File - test/fixtures/InvalidJS.soy

     Failed to parse component (javascript) file


File - test/fixtures/InvalidNamespace.soy

     Parsing failed at 1:1. Expecting:
     '{namespace'


File - test/fixtures/MissingCallImport.soy

     It looks like the following component calls are missing an import:
     
     MyExternalComponent


File - test/fixtures/MissingInternal.soy

     Based on their name, these attributes should have the .internal() config added:
     
     count_


File - test/fixtures/MissingParams.soy

     These params can't be found in STATE or your Class:
     
     optionalInfo


File - test/fixtures/MissingRender.soy

     Cannot find a .render template, do you have a typo?
     
     rander


File - test/fixtures/MissingRequired.soy

     These attributes are required in your Soy Template but not in your Component:
     
     title



     These attributes are .required() in your Component but not in your Template:
     
     description


File - test/fixtures/NoopEvents.soy

     These calls are not components, so their events param will do nothing:
     
     OtherComponent.Helper


File - test/fixtures/SortedParamDeclarations.soy

     These templates need their param declarations sorted:
     
     .render


File - test/fixtures/SortedParams.soy

     Please sort the params in these calls:
     
     OtherComponent.render - Lines 8 to 11


File - test/fixtures/TransformedImport.soy

     It looks like the following component calls are missing an import:
     
     OtherComponent


File - test/fixtures/UnsortedMap.soy

     These map keys should be sorted:
     
     Lines 10 to 12
     Lines 18 to 20
